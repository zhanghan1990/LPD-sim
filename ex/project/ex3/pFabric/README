## pfabric.sh is the shell code for the pfabric experiment
## some params should be taken care when using them 
## destdir: the destination direction you want to put your data into 
## tcl_script : the tcl file you want to execute
## top_dir: the top dir of the code
## the topolog_spt topology_tors and topology_spines just corresponds the data center topology
